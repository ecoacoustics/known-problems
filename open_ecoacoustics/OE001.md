Almost all Ecoacoustics software depends on having date stamps in the filenames of
audio recordings.

Without them we don't really know when a recording occurred and it is difficult
to use that data for science and impossible to accurately archive it.

## Status

This is problem that can occur for many reasons.

## Status with vendor

N/A


## Effects of the problem on common tools

### Acoustic Workbench (Ecosounds, A2O)

Will not accept files.

### Analysis Programs

Will process files, but some analyses/fields will not be available.

### ffmpeg/ffprobe

No effect.

### EMU

Has an open feature request for inserting header dates into filenames: https://github.com/QutEcoacoustics/emu/issues/208
