Related to [WA001](../wildlife_acoustics/WA001.md).

Acoustic sensors regularly generate empty files - that is, files that are 0 bytes in size.

This problem is distinct from small files, short files, or corrupt files.

Empty files can be hard to associate with a manufacturer, because they
have no internal metadata, hence why we have a catch all problem
identifier.
