Related to [WA001](../wildlife_acoustics/WA001.md).

Acoustic sensors regularly generate empty files - that is, files that are 0 bytes in size.

This problem is distinct from small files, short files, or corrupt files.

Empty files can be hard to associate with a manufacturer, because they
have no internal metadata, hence why we have a catch all problem
identifier.

## Effects of the problem on common tools

### EMU

EMU can detect and rename these files enmasse. See <https://github.com/QutEcoacoustics/emu/blob/master/docs/fixes.md#rename-empty-files-fix-oe004>
for an example.
