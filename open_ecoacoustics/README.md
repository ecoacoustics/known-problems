# Open Ecoacoustics

These errors are generic.
Open Ecoacoustics does not produce audio files (either through software or hardware)
and are not the source of these errors.

However these error types are common to most sensor types.
Rather than registering multiple (and possibly different) errors for each provider,
we just group them here in this namespace.

- [OE001: No date in filename](./OE001.md)
- [OE002: Ambiguous datestamps in filenames](./OE002.md)
- [OE003: Invalid Datestamp](./OE003.md)
- [OE004: Empty file](./OE004.md)
- [OE005: Null fuiles](./OE005.md)
