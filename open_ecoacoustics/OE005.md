# Null files

| Problem ID | Manufacturer                      | Affected Firmware | Affected Hardware | Status        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| OE005      | Wildlife Acoustics, Frontier Labs | (many)            | (many)            | Minor problem |

Also known as [WA002](../wildlife_acoustics/WA002.md).

Distinct from [OE004](./OE004.md), and [FL003](../frontier_labs/Fl003.md). 

Acoustic sensors can generate null files. These are files that have a length and a size,
but are filled only with zeroes.

This problem is distinct from empty files, small files, short files, or corrupt files.

Null files can be hard to associate with a manufacturer, because they
have no internal metadata, hence why we have a catch all problem
identifier.
