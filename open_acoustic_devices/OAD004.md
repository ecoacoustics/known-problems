# Bad header dates in firmware 1.2.2

|Problem ID | Manufacturer | Affected Firmware | Affected Hardware | Status              |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
|OAD004        |Open Acoustics Devices | 1.2.2 | AudioMoth 1.0.0     |   Fixed     |

The date found in the header will be incorrect because the UTC to local time adjustment is
miscalculated.

See [this commit](https://github.com/OpenAcousticDevices/AudioMoth-Firmware-Basic/commit/f653e2feaf0a64e98ae23334800990ac5886205b) for details.

## Status

**Fixed** in the next firmware 1.3.0.

The problem existed between <date>2019-10-10</date> and <date>2020-01-17</date>.

Some times in the header of the files are basically inaccurate (Â± 3600s) but only IF a fractional timezone is set and only for fimware version 1.2.2.
The filename datestamp should be unaffected.

There is no way to detect the difference in the AudioMoth comment format between versions 1.2.2 and 1.3.0.

## Effects of the problem on common tools

Some packages will report incorrect times.

### EMU

EMU's [metadata](https://github.com/QutEcoacoustics/emu/blob/master/docs/metadata.md) will automatically adjust dates when it finds discrepencies
and emit a warning.
