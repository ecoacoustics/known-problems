# known-problems
A collection of well-known problems that occur in passive acoustic monitors.

# Why
Sharing the information about issues with acoustic sensors can be time saving for other people. Researchers might experience the same issues and by sharing the workarounds and tools to deal with the issues listed here people won't have to spend time trying ot figure out what happens. It can also be useful when making a decision about which device to buy. Moreover, being a technical document it can aid when questioning vendors about their product and possible issues. 

# Status
This was writing from our own experience with acoustic sensors, but we expect contributions and additional resources/information to deal
with the issues and problems listed here. We are also working on solutions, developing tools to solve them or contacting vendors to inform them of the practical 
aspects of their products.

Contributions are welcome and should be done through the [issues tab](https://github.com/ecoacoustics/known-problems/issues).
