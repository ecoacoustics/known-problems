# known-problems
A collection of well-known problems that occur in passive acoustic monitors.
This was writing from our own experience with acoustic sensors, but we expect contributions and additional resources/information to deal
with the issues and problems listed here. We are also working on solutions, developing tools to solve them or contacting vendors to inform them of the practical 
aspects of their products.
