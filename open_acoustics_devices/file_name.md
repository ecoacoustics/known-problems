|OA03         |Open Acoustics Device |                  |   Minor problem     |

Audiomoths name the files in way that it is hard for humans to read. However, that name mean something and it is possible to rename the files in a way that it shows date and time as a normal acoustic sensor usually does.

## Tools to deal with the problem
1. Emu: Emu will change dates in files to a common and recommended date format where possible (https://github.com/QutEcoacoustics/emu#rename-your-files-audiomoth)
