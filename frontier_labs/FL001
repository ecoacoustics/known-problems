# Generating incorrect durations for FLAC files

|Problem ID | Manufacturer | Affected Firmware | Affected Hardware | Status              |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
|FL001         |Frontier Labs |     3.17 to 3.24 | BAR             |   Major problem     |


It appears that Frontier Labs writes an incorrect value for the `duration` 
in the FLAC headers.

This affects firmwares 3.17 to 3.24.

## Status
**Major problem** 

Most audio processing tools will fail eventually when they pass the point where valid data exists.

## Status with vendor

FL is aware of the issue and fixed it in version 3.24 after being notified by us

## Effects of the problem on common tools
### EMU
[EMU](https://github.com/QutEcoacoustics/emu#fix-the-fl010-metadata-duration-bug) can fix the duration of files in batch
### Audacity
Audacity opens as much of the file as is available
### SOX
Converting the file from FLAC to WAVE via sox will not fail and output as much data as is available. Becareful though: this process strips metadata from the file. We recommend fixing the files with EMU.
### Acoustics Workbench (Ecosounds, A2O)
**No**, the workbench needs correct metadata

### AnalysisPrograms.exe
**No**, but can be worked around by analyzing the first half of the file by specifying the `-s 0 -e <actual end offset>` arguments
