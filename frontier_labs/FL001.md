# Preallocated headers (near-empty corrupt files)


| Problem ID | Manufacturer  | Affected Firmware                        | Affected Hardware | Status        |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| FL001      | Frontier Labs | unknown: at least most versions of v3.0+ | BAR               | Minor problem |

Often when a sensor is interrupted - through a fault, lack of space, or a power failure, fragments of files 
produced and left in the file system.

These fragments are often:

- Occurs for both WAVE and FLAC files
- small but not empty; usually around 153 bytes for FLAC files and 44 bytes for WAVE files
- contain a `RIFF` and `WAVE` header, even if the recording format is FLAC
- and often contain incoherent or misplaced data
   - for example: a FLAC comment could be in the `data` section of a `WAVE` struct

There is no usable information on these files and they cannot be reliably repaired.

Since these files are regularly produced, and for we suspect a variety of reasons this issue may be
reflective of several smaller issues.

## Status

**Minor problem**: most tools fail to process these files,
they are mainly an annoyance, especially since at a surface level they look like small
but valid files.

## Status with vendor

It was suggested to FL they should attempt to clean up or delete such files, but this was a long time ago.
No recent contact about this issue has been attempted.

## Effects of the problem on common tools

### EMU

Emu has support for detecting this problem and renaming problem files: <https://github.com/QutEcoacoustics/emu/blob/master/docs/fixes.md#rename-stub-files-fix-fl001>

### Acoustic Workbench (Ecosounds, A2O)

Currently fail - ungracefully - to harvest files

### ffmpeg/ffprobe

Will generally produce a variety of errors such as:

```

```

The metadata command will also report roughly correct values (0 duration, 0 samples) for these files.
