# Square brackets in filenames

| Problem ID | Manufacturer  | Affected firmware | Affected hardware | Status        |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| FL004      | Frontier Labs | unknown           | BAR               | Minor problem |

Since the BARs have GPSs in them, they encode the Latitude and Longitude in the
folder and file names of their recordings. The problem is they do it using the
following format: `20160916_Cast16-001 [-37.5397
141.3252]/20160916_154131_Cast16-001-Dsk [-37.5397 141.3252].wav`. The square
brackets in filenames are often used by shells (including Bash on Linux and
PowerShell on Windows) to denote Range Wildcards. This means many common
commands, scripts, and even our workbench fail to read the files unless the
paths are treated as literals.


## Status

**Minor Problem**

## Status with vendor

Have contacted Frontier Labs, they seemed receptive to
feedback on changing the character used to denote GPS coordinates. Unsure if
they changed the default or not.

## Effects of the problem on common tools

### Acoustics Workbench (Ecosounds)

- Latest update: Slowly making our scripts more resilient to wildcard paths.

### Bash/PowerShell

Both of these shells will attempt read square brackets as wildcards.

Make sure any command that receives a path with square brackets in it is appropriately quoted.

Bad:

```bash
> sox --info 20160916_Cast16-001 [-37.5397 141.3252]/20160916_154131_Cast16-001-Dsk [-37.5397 141.3252].wav
```

Good:

```bash
> sox --info "20160916_Cast16-001 [-37.5397 141.3252]/20160916_154131_Cast16-001-Dsk [-37.5397 141.3252].wav"
```

For PowerShell many commandlets have a `-LiteralPath` argument that disables wildcards

Bad:

```powershell
cd F:\Work\GitHub\emu\test\Fixtures\FL_BAR_LT\3.03_PreallocatedHeader\20181101_AAO [-27.3866 152.8761]
# PowerShell still attempts to parse the wildcards
cd  "F:\Work\GitHub\emu\test\Fixtures\FL_BAR_LT\3.03_PreallocatedHeader\20181101_AAO [-27.3866 152.8761]"
sox --info "F:\Work\GitHub\emu\test\Fixtures\FL_BAR_LT\3.03_PreallocatedHeader\20181101_AAO [-27.3866 152.8761]\20181101_060000_REC [-27.3866 152.8761].flac"
```

Good:
```powershell
cd -LiteralPath "F:\Work\GitHub\emu\test\Fixtures\FL_BAR_LT\3.03_PreallocatedHeader\20181101_AAO [-27.3866 152.8761]"
sox --info "F:\Work\GitHub\emu\test\Fixtures\FL_BAR_LT\3.03_PreallocatedHeader\20181101_AAO [-27.3866 152.8761]\20181101_060000_REC [-27.3866 152.8761].flac"
```




## Workarounds

Command to replace square brackets in names (using rename packaged with "SUSE
Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP2" v12.2):

```
find . -name "\*\\[\*" -type d -exec rename -v '[' \_ '{}' \\;
find . -name "\*\\]\*" -type d -exec rename -v ']' \_ '{}' \\;
find . -name "\*\\]\*" -type f -exec rename -v ']' \_ '{}' \\;
find . -name "\*\\[\*" -type f -exec rename -v '[' \_ '{}' \\;
```

Using rename packaged with Ubuntu 16.04:

```
find . -depth -name "*[*" -type d -exec rename -v 's/(\]|\[)/_/g' {} \;
```

For harvesting, it is only necessary to rename the directory. This script does this in a batch
