# Incorrect SD Card Serial Number Encoded

Problem ID | Manufacturer | Affected Firmware | Affected Hardware | Status
-----------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------
FL007 | Frontier Labs | 3.30 | BAR-LT | |

Within the Vorbis Comment section of FLAC files, Frontier Labs identify the SD Card CID, represented as a 16-byte hexadecimal string. The SD Card serial number 
can be found in bytes 10-13 of that hex string.

On two test recordings made using different SD cards there seems to be a bug in which the SD Card serial number from the log file isn't matching the 
serial number encoded into the CID. As shown in the table, the bytes are matching except for the two most significant bytes in the CID serial number 
(the serial number from the log file is given in decimal and has been converted). 
It appears the CID serial numbers' two most significant bytes should instead be 0s.
