# Incorrect SD Card Serial Number Encoded

Problem ID | Manufacturer | Affected Firmware | Affected Hardware | Status
-----------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------
FL007 | Frontier Labs | 3.30 | BAR-LT | New/unconfirmed |

Within the Vorbis Comment section of FLAC files, Frontier Labs identify the SD Card CID, represented as a 16-byte hexadecimal string. The SD Card serial number 
can be found in bytes 10-13 of that hex string.

On five test recordings made using different SD cards there seems to be a bug in which the SD Card serial number from the log file isn't matching the 
serial number encoded into the CID. As shown in the table, the bytes are matching except for the two most significant bytes in the CID serial number 
(the serial number from the log file is given in decimal and has been converted). 

It appears the value in the log file is **incorrect**.

[This](https://archive.goughlui.com/static/cidecode.htm) website was used to extract the values of the CID and double check the decoded values.

We exracted values from the log files, and headers, and compared them:

(A) Recording |	(B) Log file serial number	| (C) SD card CID | (D)	serial from CID (hex) =MID(C3,19,8)  | (E) serial from CID (dec)  =HEX2DEC(D3)| (F) simulated problem =HEX2DEC( RIGHT(D3,6))

Test Recording 4| 4774740	| 0353445344313238854448DB54014801 |	4448DB54 |	1145625428 |	4774740
Test Recording 5| 14793234 |	03534453433132388046E1BA12013AFB |	46E1BA12 |	1189198354 |	14793234

In the _simulated problem column_ we can see that by trimming the hexadecimal serial value (using the `RIGHT`) function we can simulate the values found in the log file.

## Status of the problem

Minor issue, the correct data is in the **header** for the files.

Waiting for reproduction of problem from QUT Ecoacoustics

## Status with vendor

FL is not aware of the problem yet. We will reach out for comment soon.

## Effects of the problem in common tools

No effect - the CID information is currently not used in any tools we know of;
EMU may be able to detect and repair this problem if the sensor log file is found near the files.
