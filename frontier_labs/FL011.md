# Partial files named `data`


| Problem ID | Manufacturer  | Affected Firmware | Affected Hardware | Status        |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| FL011      | Frontier Labs | 3.30              | BAR               | Unconfirmed Problem |

It appears FL now write temporary files to partial extension-less `data` files.

This is a brand new behaviour and we're unsure how to deal with it.

It looks like most of the file is a valid audio file:

Open questions: 

- Does this occur for WAVE recordings too?
- Can these files be repaired?
- The log file makes no mention of these files, but it does mention files that should be present, but aren't.

## Status

**Unsure**: we've just started encountering these files.

## Status with the vendor

Unknown, they have not been contacted yet.

We need to clairfy the purpose or what is causing the production of these files.

## Effects on common tools

### Acoustic Workbench (Ecosounds, A2O)

Currently fail - ungracefully - to harvest files


### ffmpeg/ffprobe

ffprobe seems to process the file with no issues.


### EMU

Emu has no support for this problem. Tracking issue: <https://github.com/QutEcoacoustics/emu/issues/198>
