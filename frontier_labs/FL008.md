# Invalid datestamps in file names (space instead of a zero)

| Problem ID | Manufacturer  | Affected Firmware | Affected Hardware | Status          |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| FL008      | Frontier Labs | 3.08              | BAR-LT            | New/unconfirmed |

It appears that some files produced by the BAR-LTs are emitted with a filename that has a faulty time stamp.

Such files appear to sometimes have a `0` leading digit in the _day_ field of the datestamp replaced with a ` ` (a space).
The problem does not seem to apply when the day of the month is greater or equal to `10` (i.e. when a non-zero is required in the datestamp) 
and does not affect the daily sub-directories created by the sensors.

Excerpts from the log files confirm a space is used instead of a 0 in the sensors's view of the world - this is not a bug with the sensor.

Some files from our filesystem:

- ./255/445/20190324_AAO/20190324T060000+1000_REC.flac
- ./255/445/20190508_AAO/201905 8T020000+1000_REC.flac
- ./255/445/20190508_AAO/201905 8T200000+1000_REC.flac
- ./255/445/20190415_AAO/20190415T200000+1000_REC.flac
- ./255/445/20190408_AAO/201904 8T060000+1000_REC.flac
- ./255/445/20190405_AAO/201904 5T080000+1000_REC.flac

A count of affected files finds the problem in 1499 files out of 5572 (26%).

## Status of the problem

Minor issue, the correct data is in the **header** for the files.

## Status with vendor

FL is not aware of the problem yet. We will reach out for comment soon.

## Effects of the problem in common tools

Most tools we are aware of do not cater for date stamps with spaces in place of 0 digits.

- EMU does not handle this (issue: )
- AP.exe does not handle this date format
- The acoustic workbench does not handle this date format
